## Azure Application Gateway

**Azure Application Gateway** is a web traffic load balancer that enables you to manage and route traffic based on advanced HTTP(S) routing rules. It operates at the **Application Layer (Layer 7)** of the OSI model, which allows for more granular control of web traffic compared to Layer 4 load balancers like the Azure Load Balancer.

![lb02](/images/lb02.png)
### Key Features of Azure Application Gateway

1. **Layer 7 Load Balancing**
   - Unlike the Azure Load Balancer, which works at Layer 4 (TCP/UDP), **Application Gateway** works at Layer 7 (HTTP/HTTPS), allowing routing decisions based on URL paths, host headers, HTTP methods, and other content-based criteria.

2. **URL-based Routing**
   - Application Gateway can route traffic based on the URL path, enabling you to route different types of traffic to different backend pools. For example:
     - `/images` can route to one pool of servers.
     - `/api` can route to another pool.
   
3. **Host-based Routing**
   - Traffic can be routed based on the domain name (host) in the request. This is useful for multi-tenant applications or handling traffic for multiple websites hosted behind the same gateway.

4. **SSL/TLS Termination**
   - Application Gateway can handle SSL/TLS termination (decryption of secure traffic). This offloads the decryption process from backend servers, improving their performance.

5. **Web Application Firewall (WAF)**
   - Application Gateway integrates with **Azure Web Application Firewall (WAF)**, providing centralized protection against common threats like SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and other OWASP top 10 vulnerabilities.
   - WAF can be configured with custom rules for enhanced security.

6. **Autoscaling**
   - Azure Application Gateway supports autoscaling, which adjusts the number of gateway instances based on the incoming traffic, ensuring that you always have the right amount of resources to handle the load.

7. **Session Affinity (Cookie-based routing)**
   - Application Gateway can route requests from a particular user to the same backend server using session affinity (based on a cookie). This ensures that requests from the same user are consistently handled by the same backend for stateful applications.

8. **Multi-site Hosting**
   - Supports hosting multiple websites on the same Application Gateway, routing traffic based on different URL paths or host headers.

9. **Custom Health Probes**
   - Custom health probes are available to monitor the health of backend servers or services. The gateway will only route traffic to healthy resources, ensuring availability.

10. **Redirection**
   - Azure Application Gateway allows you to redirect traffic from one URL to another. For example, you can configure it to redirect HTTP traffic to HTTPS.

---

### How Azure Application Gateway Works

- **Traffic Routing**: When a request is sent to an Application Gateway, the gateway inspects the HTTP(S) request based on the configured routing rules. The traffic is then directed to the appropriate backend pool or service.
- **Health Monitoring**: The gateway constantly monitors the health of backend servers using health probes. If a server is unhealthy, the gateway reroutes traffic to a healthy instance.
- **SSL Termination**: Application Gateway decrypts incoming SSL/TLS traffic, inspects the traffic, and forwards it to the backend as unencrypted HTTP traffic. This improves backend server performance by offloading SSL processing.
- **Firewall Protection**: The WAF functionality inspects HTTP traffic for malicious patterns, blocking traffic that matches predefined rules for common web vulnerabilities.

---

### How Azure CDN Works

1. **Request Routing**:
   - When a user requests content, Azure CDN directs the request to the nearest edge server based on geographic location, network conditions, and other factors.
   
2. **Content Caching**:
   - The edge server checks if the requested content is already cached. If it is, the server delivers the cached content directly to the user. If it’s not cached, the CDN server fetches the content from the origin server and caches it for future requests.

3. **Content Delivery**:
   - Once the content is cached at the edge server, subsequent users who request the same content will receive it from the edge server, reducing latency and improving performance.

4. **Cache Expiration and Purge**:
   - Content in the cache is served for a specific duration (TTL - Time to Live) before it expires. After expiration, the CDN will fetch fresh content from the origin. You can also manually purge content from the cache if updates are required.
